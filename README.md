## General info
This project is a web app that allows employers to create job postings, and then users to search for a job through the list of jobs, and then to send an application for a chosen posting. There will be an admin account, where administrators can see all the users in the system, see all the postings; if needed; to update or edit them. The admin account will be able to add or remove users, employers or postings. We will also be designing a database that will store the users(including admin and employer accounts), the job postings and the applications.
